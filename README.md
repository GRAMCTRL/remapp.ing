## Getting Started

1. **Download the Firmware Files:**
   - [Nuke.uf2](https://github.com/Gadgetoid/pico-universal-flash-nuke/releases/download/v1.0.1/universal_flash_nuke.uf2)
   - [firmware.uf2](https://github.com/GRAMCTRL/HayBox-GRAM/releases/)
     - Please note that if you are not using a GRAM controller then you'll likely want to look for firmware from your controller manufacturer. Make sure that it uses Haybox 3.0.0+!
2. **Enter Boot Select Mode:**
   - Hold the **A** button on your controller while plugging it into your PC via USB.
      - If you aren't on a GRAM controller, **START** is a common button to enter BOOTSEL mode. Double check with your controller manufacturer if you have any issues with this.
   - A file explorer window will pop up.
3. **Flash the Firmware:**
   - Drag and drop `Nuke.uf2` into the file explorer.
   - Wait for the file explorer to close and reopen (this takes about 10 seconds).
   - Drag and drop `firmware.uf2` into the file explorer.
   - Once it closes again, unplug your controller.
4. **Reconnect Your Controller:**
   - Open [remapp.ing](https://remapp.ing/) in Chrome.
   - Hold **START** while plugging your controller back in to enter CONFIG mode.
      - If you aren't on a GRAM controller, other common buttons to enter CONFIG mode include **C-Down**, **A**, and **C-Right**. Double check with your controller manufacturer if you have any issues with this.
   - Click **CONNECT** and select your controller from the WebSerial popup menu.
      - Please note that only Chromium browsers support WebSerial.
      - If you're on Firefox, there may be WebSerial add-ons that add support, however they may not work with remapp.ing. 
   - Continue to Proceed to remap. Use the interface to:
     - Adjust mappings.
     - Select different modes to remap in the bottom left corner.
     - Reset your current modes remappings using the **Nuke** button.
     - Save your configuration to your controller by clicking the **Floppy Disc Save** icon.
